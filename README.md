# Resilient Project: Timeseries Forecasting Workshop
Notebooks for a workshop for the RESILIENT Project that looks at modelling mini-grids in Kenya.

These notebooks closely follow the following TensorFlow tutorials:

- [Neural Networks](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/e891a2474f6c40e9732478deaf355644d55baf7f/site/en/tutorials/structured_data/time_series.ipynb)
- [Bayesian Structural Time Series](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/6291ecc523bb47c72218e4559e257f82fcdc7152/tensorflow_probability/examples/jupyter_notebooks/Structural_Time_Series_Modeling_Case_Studies_Atmospheric_CO2_and_Electricity_Demand.ipynb) 


## Package Versions
OS: Windows 10 Enterprise

python==3.10.8  
matplotlib==3.6.2  
numpy==1.24.1  
pandas==1.5.2  
scikit-learn==1.2.1  
seaborn==0.12.2  
tensorflow==2.11.0

## Notebooks
This repository contains 4 notebooks that work through the creation of `neural network` and `structural time` series forecasting models for `electrical load` and `PV generation` data.

## Exercises
1. Install Python through Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
2. Install the above packages
3. Download the data and notebooks and try to run through the code.
4. Train your own neural network models to forecast the "panama_data"

Rough template solutions are included in the `exercise_solutions.ipynb` notebook
